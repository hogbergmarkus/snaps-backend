# Snaps - API

## Introduction

![Welcome message](documentation/images/welcome_message.png)

This is my RESTful API, developed for my frontend React project, Snaps.

It contains all the logic that allows users on the frontend to perform CRUD operations.

Snaps is a photo-sharing website that allows users to upload photos to share with others.

Any photos uploaded to the website is also free to download for other users, thereby creating a sharing community.

Users can sign up to take part in interactions such as, up- and downloading images, like, comment and save images to albums in their profile.
